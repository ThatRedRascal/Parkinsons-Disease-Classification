# Parkinsons-Disease-Classification
Parkinsons disease is a serious neural disorder. It affects the central nervous system and is lethal in most cases. Symptoms include tremors and low dopamine levels which may lead to stress. This disease has five stages and is progressive, just like cancer. And just like cancer, it has no cure yet.  Medications help control the symptoms of Parkinsons but only till a certain time. This project aims at making a parkinsons disease classification system with available data from the open source University of California Irvine database and I hope one day we can perfect such algorithms to pinpoint a solution to this problem.
